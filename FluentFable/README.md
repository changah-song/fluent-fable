To-do..

MVP
- Database (expo sql) // done
- Flashcard (colorfy)

Less Priority
- Naver dictionary API
- Language selection
- Reload chatGPT prompt
- Generating prompt based on skill-level

Less less Priority
- Create prompts without words already known by user
- Anki curve
- Import PDF/EPUD/MOBI (! much more work to implement)

Other ideas
- After five words are learned, create paragraph using those words and save. Suggest them to check it with native speaker (reddit, friends, etc.)
