# Fluent Fable

Reading is the best way for language acquisition. 
This app aims to make the process of reading and learning as seamless as possible for Korean learners.

You can:
- 📚 **load** books of your choice
- ☝️ **click once** to see the word's dictionary entry and its Hanja
- ✌️ **click twice** to see the sentence's translation (Google or Papago)
- 🔎 **explore** the Hanja of Korean words to form a better understanding and find connections between known words
- 📝 **learn** vocab through the Flashcard feature using spaced repetition for optimal memorization
